# Backup & Restore System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive backup and restore system for the OWU Palace HRMS project. The system will provide one-click backup creation and restoration functionality, enabling seamless data migration between databases and ensuring data protection through automated backup processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: One-Click Backup Creation

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to create a complete database backup with one click, so that I can quickly preserve all system data for migration or disaster recovery purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super administrator clicks the "Create Backup" button THEN the system SHALL export all database tables and relationships into a compressed backup file
2. WHEN the backup process starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing the backup creation status
3. WHEN the backup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link for the backup file
4. WHEN creating a backup THEN the system SHALL include metadata with timestamp, record counts, and backup ID
5. WHEN the backup file is generated THEN the system SHALL use ZIP compression to minimize file size
6. WHEN backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and maintain system stability

### Requirement 2: One-Click Restore Functionality

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to restore a complete database from a backup file with one click, so that I can quickly migrate data between environments or recover from data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super administrator uploads a backup file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
2. WHEN initiating a restore operation THEN the system SHALL display clear warnings about data replacement
3. WHEN the restore process starts THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure atomic operations
4. WHEN restoring data THEN the system SHALL completely replace existing data with backup data
5. WHEN the restore is complete THEN the system SHALL refresh the application to reflect changes
6. WHEN restore fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and maintain data integrity
7. WHEN restore succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the operation with timestamp and backup details

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Data Coverage

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want backups to include all system data and relationships, so that restored systems are fully functional with complete data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a backup THEN the system SHALL include all admin accounts with permissions
2. WHEN creating a backup THEN the system SHALL include all staff records with complete relationships
3. WHEN creating a backup THEN the system SHALL include all categories, salary structures, and loan records
4. WHEN creating a backup THEN the system SHALL include all issues, files, and shareable links
5. WHEN creating a backup THEN the system SHALL preserve all foreign key relationships
6. WHEN restoring data THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity across all tables
7. WHEN backup includes sensitive data THEN the system SHALL mask database connection strings in metadata

### Requirement 4: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want backup and restore operations to be restricted to super administrators only, so that sensitive data operations are properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses backup functionality THEN the system SHALL verify SUPER_ADMIN role permissions
2. WHEN a non-super-admin attempts backup operations THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error messages
3. WHEN backup files are stored THEN the system SHALL protect them with appropriate file permissions
4. WHEN backup operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log all activities for audit purposes
5. WHEN displaying backup metadata THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive information like database URLs

### Requirement 5: File Management and Storage

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to manage backup files through a web interface, so that I can organize, download, and clean up backup files efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the backup management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all available backup files
2. WHEN displaying backup files THEN the system SHALL show file size, creation date, and download options
3. WHEN a super administrator clicks download THEN the system SHALL serve the backup file for download
4. WHEN a super administrator deletes a backup THEN the system SHALL remove the file and update the listing
5. WHEN backup files are created THEN the system SHALL use timestamp-based naming conventions
6. WHEN the backup directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want an intuitive and responsive interface for backup operations, so that I can efficiently manage data backup and restore processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the backup page THEN the system SHALL display a clean, responsive interface
2. WHEN performing backup operations THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators
3. WHEN uploading restore files THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop file selection
4. WHEN confirming dangerous operations THEN the system SHALL display clear warning dialogs
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL show success messages with relevant details
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 7: CLI and Automation Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want command-line backup tools, so that I can automate backup creation through scripts and scheduled tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the CLI backup command THEN the system SHALL create a backup without web interface
2. WHEN CLI backup runs THEN the system SHALL display detailed progress and logging information
3. WHEN CLI backup completes THEN the system SHALL output backup file location and statistics
4. WHEN CLI backup fails THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate error codes
5. WHEN integrating with cron jobs THEN the system SHALL support silent operation modes

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want robust error handling during backup and restore operations, so that system failures don't corrupt data or leave the system in an unstable state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup creation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL clean up partial files and report specific issues
2. WHEN restore operations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes using database transactions
3. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files automatically
4. WHEN network interruptions occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
5. WHEN disk space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL detect and report storage issues
6. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want backup and restore operations to handle large datasets efficiently, so that system performance remains acceptable even with substantial data volumes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use streaming operations to manage memory usage
2. WHEN creating backups THEN the system SHALL compress data to minimize file sizes
3. WHEN uploading large restore files THEN the system SHALL support files up to 100MB
4. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL use batch processing for efficiency
5. WHEN multiple operations run THEN the system SHALL prevent concurrent backup/restore conflicts

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of backup and restore operations, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup operations start THEN the system SHALL log the operation with user and timestamp
2. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL log success status with file details
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN restore operations run THEN the system SHALL log data replacement details
5. WHEN CLI operations execute THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options
