# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide for Owu Palace HRMS

## ⚡ TL;DR - Fastest Deployment

### 1. Backend (Railway) - 5 minutes
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → Login with GitHub
2. **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub** → Select `akinbinufemi/owu-hr`
3. **Add these environment variables**:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=owu-palace-super-secret-jwt-key-2024-production
   FRONTEND_URL=https://owu-palace-hrms.netlify.app
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
4. **Set Root Directory**: `backend`
5. **Deploy** → Copy the Railway URL (e.g., `https://owu-hr-production.railway.app`)

### 2. Frontend (Netlify) - 3 minutes
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) → Login with GitHub
2. **New site from Git** → Select `akinbinufemi/owu-hr`
3. **Build settings**:
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/build`
4. **Add environment variable**:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://owu-hr-production.railway.app/api
   ```
5. **Deploy** → Your site will be live!

## 🎯 Why This Split Approach?

| Service | Purpose | Cost | Best For |
|---------|---------|------|----------|
| **Netlify** | React Frontend | FREE | Static sites, CDN, SSL |
| **Railway** | Node.js Backend + Database | FREE tier | Server apps, databases |

**Total Cost**: $0/month for small usage (perfect for testing/demo)

## 🔧 Alternative Platforms

### If Railway is full:
- **Render**: Same process, go to [render.com](https://render.com)
- **Heroku**: More expensive but reliable
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Good performance

### If you want everything on one platform:
- **Vercel**: Can host both frontend and backend
- **Railway**: Can host both as separate services

---

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### ❌ "Network Error" on login
**Solution**: Check that `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to your Railway URL

### ❌ CORS errors
**Solution**: Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway matches your Netlify URL exactly

### ❌ Database connection failed
**Solution**: Railway auto-provides `DATABASE_URL`, don't override it

### ❌ Build failed on Netlify
**Solution**: Make sure base directory is set to `frontend`
